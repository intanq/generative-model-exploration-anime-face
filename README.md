# Generative Model Exploration on Anime Face Dataset
In this repository, generative models will be explored by using anime face dataset that can be accessed from this link (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/splcher/animefacedataset).

There are two main generative models that are explored, namely DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarian Networks) and VAE (Variational Autoencoder).
